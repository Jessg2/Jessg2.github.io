        AI as a concept is justifiably making a lot of people uneasy. With the added conveniences that it could potentially offer I see how many people are
        afraid of losing their jobs due to more artificial technologies being developed. For design specifically there are situations where it could basically
        rewrite everything you once knew and remove all of the steps needed to be done by a human being. There are many points I honestly agree with but also
        disagree with the author. One of the points that I would like to discuss is how web design jobs could be taken over. On page 3 of the article Michael 
        Buckley raises the argument specifically in the quote, “For example, Wix and Framer offer excellent integrated web-building tools. With just a few 
        prompts and clicks, non-designers could have a fully designed website up and running in a matter of minutes” (Buckley, 3). I see how websites like 
        Wix or Squarespace could take the creativity out of designing websites without any help and in a way they take away jobs just like how the title 
        suggests it. As a result, some websites may appear to look bland and not have that much personality to them.

        I think there could be too much worrying though. Many times in the article it seems like Buckley is suggesting that AI will take the role of design in every aspect of how we use technologies. 
        Like app stores, programs, and even how we just go through the internet. Now for the last point It is clear that some companies are already doing this, like Bing using  
        ChatGpt to aid users in finding information more easily. This in a way could also take some profit away from companies and also reduce the need for web developers in general 
        because less people would be clicking on those specific websites if they get the information fed through them thanks to some sort of program. 
        For app stores, I don’t think those will ever go away because it’s a necessary way for people to obviously get apps on their phones and I think if AI would ever be the only way to get apps that 
        would be a very bad idea. There are ways where AI could help design rather than be the only driving force behind design where it can aid us, but not take over jobs. There are companies using AI to 
        better help the design process and make their jobs easier, while also not solely relying on AI to do their jobs. An example of a company doing this is the company rabbit who made R1S. 
        This system is similar to a phone’s AI powered assistant like Siri or Google assistant but instead it’s made into a separate product. It’s more like a phone in more ways than not but 
        the AI is merged into the phone like product to hopefully make tasks much easier. 
        This would mean less buttons to do what you want, being able to speak to the device, and much more. For example, in the trailer it shows the user using just regular language, 
        like how you would ask someone else to do something not a phone’s assistant. Then it continued to have the device repeat back what they wanted to hear, that being the uber being ordered and driving them home.
      </p>
      <P>
        I think there are many other ways that AI could be used to help designers. 
        I also know that there are ways it can be abused and perhaps take away 
        jobs for different people. I think that we will be able to catch up with 
        it more though with more people being aware of the issues it could present.
