          It honestly felt pretty good to act in front of an audience. 
          I would not have realized that the nerves weren’t really there 
          in the first place, I did some things for this to happen though. 
          For one, I made sure to actually feel nervous and kinda get all 
          of those feelings out way before the performance so I had time 
          to gain enough courage to perform in front of the audience. 
          I did not notice any tension in the performer's mask that appeared, 
          I was pretty much going with the flow during the whole performance 
          and took it maybe not as smooth as I wanted but did much better than 
          expected. That means at least to me that there weren’t really any moments 
          I needed to address. I now know what I need to work on in the future. 
          There are many aspects to where I could have worked on the material more 
          and be more concise with my wording. I felt myself experience the scene more 
          and in a way actually construct it not from the ground up but with specific 
          building blocks that helped me use what I already knew to create new scenes of this exact entrance. 
          I took the advice to heart and tried to improve each time I went through the actor’s entrances. 
          The saxophone one felt the most alive to me because it felt like I had just watched the memory 
          back again in my head after performing those specific actions and what actually happened, 
          because it was a piece from my life. That’s what made it more easily to view in my mind. 
          The three elements that helped me prepare are as follows: Calming myself, 
          remembering my lines, and just organizing the structure more. 
          These all helped me in some way. I think the element that helped me the most though is actually 
          organizing the structure because I found in that case it helped me to know what I needed to work 
          on more with the entire project. If I believed that I was in the scene I had to add more details 
          to it without having to add more words necessarily. I think the overall entrances benefited from that. 
          I would go back to work on preparing more because then I would have had an easier time.
