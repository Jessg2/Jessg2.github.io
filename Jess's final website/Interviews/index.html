<p>	Q. For my first question, how did you get started with producing music in general? Where did you find the passion for it?</p>
<p> A. Devin - Well, for 1, I like to co-produce, but you could also call me a producer cause I do a lot and co-prod a lot. Just starting with that lol. I got started first semester freshman year because my roommate is a music major, and it gave me confidence. However, a few years ago in high school I had trade school classes where I learned audio and recording, and I’ve fell in love with somehow trying to get my voice to sound good on music lol. My passion is because music runs my life. I consume so much and I have since I was little. It’s something that really connects with people and entertain people, and as you may guess since I’m a part actor and a film major, I love entertaining people. My roommate boosted my confidence when I got to Columbia, and seeing how not super hard it is, and the creative control, it hooked me.</p>
<p> Q. The second question that I have for you is what is your favorite DAW to use? I use Studio One personally but I”m not sure that is the best one for beginners. Do you recommend only using a DAW if you’re just starting? Or would it be better to get actual equipment that you can use hands-on like synths, mpcs, and others?</p>
<p> A. My favorite DAW to use is probably Logic Pro, because that is what I first learned on, however at this point I would have to re-teach myself, as I haven’t used it since that trade school. I currently use FL studio and I will say it’s a close second for me. The features of FL are a little weird and can be hard to work with(I still am trying to work my way thru it) but, FL is a really nice platform for my genre, which I really don’t know how to describe, it’s like plugg and hip hop or trap. And no, starting out a DAW is key. Analogue instruments are really expensive, and the cheap ones can only do so much. To get one that might work you’ll be dropping at least 200 dollars. DAWS like FL are really nice because they have sounds and loops for you that you can use, on top of the limitless sounds you can download and buy. Plugins on FL are also pretty good. And while using analogue instruments you’re still most likely using a DAW.</p>
<p> Q.For my third question I would like to know more about how to get your name out there. Perhaps there were avenues where you could get your music heard? What are some of the steps? Like if I were ever to want someone else use a beat of mine what would be the best way, since I know you have gone through that process before? </p>
<p> A. Getting your name out there is hard but also not. I am still pretty small so I too am still working to get mine out there. Networking is key. I’ve been to many shows that include people from the Chicago music scene and beyond. I also try to keep tabs on a BUNCH of people on social media. Personally, my initial growth was due to tons of friends back home that were curious of my music, and they actually liked it so that helped. But now a lot of people in Chicago are noticing me. That’s due to the networking. I meet people involved in music or film, and a lot of times they have friends that do the same things, you know. In the context of sending me beats, the best way is to just get ahold of me in a way you know I would answer. I.e. instagram or email. When sending me the beat I’ll give you my email and you’ll send me the export .wav or .mp3 or whatever file you have. But talk to your artist and make sure you agree on how stuff is getting done. Talk splits (money splits for you and Your artist) and talk everything. But don’t hound them, they might just leave you on read. Also to release music on your own, you’re going to need a distribution platform like distrokid.  For practice and focus, I honestly don’t have that much, but at the same time I do have multiple credits to my name. I’ve put in my work, but I could still do more you know.</p>
<p> Q. How much practicing and learning did you have to do for producing music in general, is it necessary to put the classic 10,000 hours into it before you decide you’re good at it? What’s the best way to improve at actually making the instrumental?  </p>
<p> A. But no you don’t have to have your 10,000 hours, if you like it keep going, and you’ll naturally get your 10,000. Just prod and you’ll keep getting better, and watch videos on the details of proding and mixing. To improve in your music instrumentals, just listen to so much music man. One of the biggest things is putting in your homework of what people are doing and how stuff works and just how music plays off of each other and how it fits.</p> 
<p> Q. What are some of the biggest hardships you went through when you started making music? Like were there any roadblocks that you had to pivot through to get better or any sort of writer’s block too? I know with producing it can be hard to make original music sothat’s why people use samples to help them out, are you much of a sampler or did you make your original sounds?</p>
<p> A. My biggest hardships honestly are writing/producing block. I’ll make a really good song then feel like I have already had a career and need to retire lmao. I just get blocked from time to time because I still need to expand and focus. Also samples and originality is something I like to toy with. Samples are actually really good as long as you don’t use samples for the ENTIRE beat.When it comes to originality me and my roommates really like to draw from our inspirations and include little tidbits of things we liked and wanted to try from other songs we know, then flip those in a way that’s unique to us. </p>
<p> Q. I think one of the most important aspects and difficult to understand for producing music is mixing. Making each part of the instrumental like the Hi-Hats and the 808s sound just right can get a little intense. How do you think you are with that specific topic? I have a ton of learning to do with mixing and was wanting to know how you started with that too and where you ended up. </p>  
<p> A.With mixing it’s a love hate relationship. I know basic mixing and how to make my stuff sound good, but like the fine details of mixing that can really make a difference sonically, I honestly don’t know a lot, my roommate is better at that then me. But mixing is a beast man. Watch lots of YouTube videos on it and just really play around with different components of mixing, or try mixing things to the quality of a song you like. Mixing/ putting on effects to my projects however is probably one of my strengths, yet there is still so much for me to learn. I wanted to produce music because as an artist, I like having music behind me that I know I had a hand in, and is unique.</p>
<p> Q. One of the last questions that I’m going to ask is what made you produce music in the first place? Were there any other circumstances surrounding it that made you want to pursue that profession, what do you think about it? Do you see yourself producing music full-time in the future? OR maybe putting it on the back burner, how has your passion grown for it or has it kinda flatlined? I’m worried that if I don’t spend enough time on making beats or learning how to produce then that will happen. </p>  
<p> A. With music in general I started because 1 my love for music is huge, and 2 the chance for the money intrigues me, as someone who does not have a lot of money to work with. Especially being at a school that takes most of what I have. I do see myself producing for the rest of my life, even if I were to stop being a vocalist. Honestly, producing is something to spend as much time as possible on. If you like it enough, you’ll most likely not stop. My advice that I could give you is get out there and start talking to people. Make connections. Connections are key. You may think you can do all of this on your own, but at the end of the day if you don’t know anybody, then nobody knows you. Also, don’t let the lack of following bring you down. </p>
<p> Q. The last question that I want to ask you is what are some final thoughts and advice you want to give me on producingt music? Like I said earlier I’m just starting and am unsure of where to go from here honestly because it’s one of the avenues I want to pursue more because I am finding myself getting better with it day by day. I know it can be hard with music producing to not compare yourself to others and how your beats sound today, is there any way around it? I understand that everyone has to start somewhere though and I am at the beginning level still even after a year of producing beats.</p>
<p> A. Just because only 11 people listen to you now, doesn’t that those 11 people won’t go out and tell their friends or anybody else. Those 11 people are going to tell people if they truly like your work. Then that 11 will turn into 100 before you know it, then 1000 and so on. Also, don’t cater to your fans. You’re doing this for you right? So do what you want to do and don’t let your fans tell you otherwise. However, pay attention to them and what they like better. And listen to them a little bit and take criticism, but don’t go making country music because someone told you you can’t make rap. You can, you just have to learn more and do better yk. Go to shows, go to events, scour the internet for people. MAKE CONNECTIONS!!!!!</p>
